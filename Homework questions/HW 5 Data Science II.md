Homework Assignment for next week  

You're going to put your skills to the test this week! Inside of our Google Classroom Drive, you'll see a .csv file called "income_evaluation.csv". This is a collected dataset of approximately 32,000 individuals that contains some demographic and professional characteristics, as well as binary variable of whether or not they make over $50k a year in salary. Your job is to build the most accurate model that you can to predict whether a given individual makes over $50k a year!

Here are the rules:   

1. Your work must be reproducible (i.e., use set.seed(xxx) at the beginning of your code to make sure you always get the same results.   
2. You must use a 50% training, 50% test split.   
3. You must report the following metrics for your model: Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity.   
4. You can do any kind of transformations you want to the dataset - your goal isn't to explain how your model works, but to make it as predictive as possible. However, if you do subset selection (i.e., dropping variables) or make new ones because of some exploratory data exploration (like making plots) - show your work.
